This is a FreeRTOS port to the Olimex STM32-E407 board, using just a
bare GCC build environment.

Architecture:	ARM Cortex M4F
Chip:		STM32F407ZET6
Board:		Olimex STM32-E407
Toolchain:	GCC (arm-linux-gnueabi)
SDK:		GNU Make
Build platform:	Linux (Ubuntu 13.04)


Application:

for now, we just blink the LED, to see that everything's okay


Naming:

in case we keep this generic and want to follow existing style, the
name should be something like CORTEX_M4F_STM32F407ZG-Olimex-E407
which is painfully long.

For now, we just use E407.
